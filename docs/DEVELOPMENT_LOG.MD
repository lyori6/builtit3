# BuiltIt.dev Website Development Log

## Initial Project Assessment - May 18, 2025

### Project Structure Analysis
- Framework: The project uses React with Vite (rather than Next.js mentioned in the PRD)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Current Component Structure:
  - All required sections already exist as components: Navbar, HeroSection, WhatIsSection, FeatureSection, SprintSection, PortfolioSection, AdvantageSection, AboutSection, TestimonialsSection, ContactSection, Footer
- Current styling needs updating to match the new design requirements in PRD V1.3

### Color Palette Analysis
- Current colors in tailwind.config.js:
  - background: '#0b0d1a' (needs updating to Deep Charcoal '#0D0E11')
  - surface: '#11131f' (needs updating to Dark Slate '#1A1B20')
  - primary: '#a259ff' (needs updating to Electric Purple '#7000FF')
  - accent: '#c6ff00' (needs updating to Acid Lime '#B2FF59')
  - neutral: '#e5e7eb' (roughly matches Primary Text '#E0E0E0')
- Note: Project memory mentioned turquoise (#00C9B7) and purple (#4F46E5) colors, but we're following the PRD V1.3 specifications
