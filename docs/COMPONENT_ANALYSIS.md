# BuiltIt.dev Component Analysis

## Overview
This document provides an analysis of each existing component and outlines the specific changes needed to align with the requirements in PRD_BUILTIT_V1.3.md.

## Color Palette Considerations

I've noticed a discrepancy between our records:

- **PRD V1.3 Palette**: 
  - Primary Accent (Electric Purple): `#7000FF`
  - Secondary Accent (Acid Lime): `#B2FF59`

- **Project Memory**: 
  - Project accent color (turquoise): `#00C9B7`
  - Secondary color (purple): `#4F46E5`

For our planning purposes, I'll prioritize the PRD V1.3 specifications while noting this discrepancy for review.
